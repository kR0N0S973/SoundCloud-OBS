# SoundCloud-OBS

Just ignore how its coded, its shit, but hey, its working, so, pshh

This is just currently a helper tool to get the NowPlaying feature for SoundCloud in OBS Studio, but you can also use it as SoundCloud player, 
when you start it and log into you soundcloud account it starts fetching the html and outputs it into a "currentSong.txt" and it creates a local
webserver for showing an index.html file created on launch. You can edit it as you like

###

Currently supporting only x86 release, compile it yourself if you need other requirements.

###

To Change the widget style after first launching, you will find a "Widget" folder in the .exe directory, there is an index.html, edit it, even during 
the program is open and you can refresh the WidgetBrowser with the button.

###

This project has nothing to do with SoundCloud itselfs.
