This is just currently a helper tool to get the NowPlaying feature for SoundCloud in OBS Studio, but you can also use it as SoundCloud player, 
when you start it and log into you soundcloud account it starts fetching the html and outputs it into a "currentSong.txt" and it creates a local
webserver for showing an index.html file created on launch. You can edit it as you like
